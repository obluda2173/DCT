* On this project
This project is a naive (unoptimised) JPEG encoder. The project aim is to deepen my understanding of Discrete Cosine Transformation which is part of my Linear Algebra course. Project is not a university assignment in any way.

* Most interesting

The core of this project would be the 1-Dimensional DCT formula below:

$C(u) = \alpha(u) \sum_{x=0}^{N-1}f(x)cos\biggr[\dfrac{\pi(2x+1)u}{2N}\biggr]$
where:
- $u$: The frequency index (which wave pattern we are checking).
- $N$: The total number of samples (e.g., 8).
- $f(x)$: The input signal (pixel value at spot $x$).
- $\cos[...]$: The cosine wave "ingredient."
- $\sum$: The sum (we multiply the input by the wave and sum it up to check for similarity).
